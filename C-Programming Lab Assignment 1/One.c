/*The core distinction between printf() and puts() centers on their functionalities and intended use cases:

printf() shines as a versatile tool for formatted output. It empowers you to meticulously control the 
presentation of variables using format specifiers, crafting custom output layouts. This flexibility makes it ideal
for scenarios demanding precise formatting and handling diverse data types.

puts(), on the other hand, excels in straightforward string printing. It streamlines the process by
automatically appending a newline character, ensuring a new line after each printed string.
This simplicity makes it a favored choice for quick and uncomplicated string output.*/
